#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

• I also thoroughly enjoy exploring the physical and nutritional aspects of health and fitness, I train calisthenics, basic gymnastics, kettlebell and weight training, swimming, rock climbing.
Martials arts Canterbury and London
• Practising and training MMA for over a year, including Muay Thai, striking, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and wrestling, I think having the skills and strength to handle a dangerous situation are extremely useful to have, not only for de-escalation but for prevention, practising these sports has taught me discipline and the ability to be patient, and willing to fail to succeed
• Competed after only a few months of training (and lost) because the coach said I'd be allowed, and entered a division 10kg above my weight class
