#### Communication
Communication is a skill I've been nurturing and developing for the past 4 years, I've been studying how to communicate in various medium to be able to get the ideas across, and understand others, in the best way. All services rely heavily on communication, especially when it comes to design, and when I studied Architecture in university, one thing that my tutors loved seeing was my keen sense of creative design and how I was willing to explore abstract ideas, they had confidence in my ideas because of how well I was able to communicate them. I sometimes notice when others feel anxious when communicating their emotions and ideas and do my best to encourage them to do so or assist them in their communication, I feel that this build a strong sense of camaraderie and build superb teams!
